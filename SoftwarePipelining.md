## Software pipelining

### Loop unrolling (for "DoAll" loops)

**Length of u iteration** = length of it + initiation interval (u - 1)
**Execution time per source iteration** = Length of u iteration / u ‚Üí lim to ‚àû = initiation interval

The wider the machine the more you unroll

### Software pipelined code

Unlike loop unrolling we always use the same schedule. That way you find an steady state.

**Execution time for pipelined code** = Steady state size * iterations + remaining operations.

The locally compacted code may not be optimal, but we only care that the steady state is tight.

With "doAccross" loops there's a limit of how much you can parallelise the code.

#### Resource bound on Initiation Interval

```
for all resource i
  number of units require by one iteration: n<sub>i</sub>
  number of units in system: R<sub>i</sub>
  
Lower bound = max<sub>i</sub> n<sub>i</sub>/R<sub>i</sub>
```

#### Scheduling constraint: Resource

**Initiation interval = size of steady state**

#### Scheduling constraint: Precedence

Label edges with <ùõø, d>
* ùõø = iteration difference
* d = delay

```
ùõø * T + S(n<sub>2</sub>) - S(n<sub>1</sub>)  ‚â• d
```

Cycles in the dependence graph mean that now you're bound on both ends. You can't stretch T arbitrarily 

**Algorithm for bound on Initiation Interval based on precedence**
```
for all cycles c,
  max<sub>c</sub> CycleLength(c) / Iteration difference(c)
```

### Algorithm for Acyclic graphs

```
Find lower bound of initiation interval: T<sub>0</sub>
  based on resource constraints

For T = T<sub>0</sub>, T<sub>0</sub> + 1, ... until all nodes are scheduled
  For each node n in topological order
    s<sub>0</sub> = earliest n can be scheduled
    for each s = s<sub>0</sub>, s<sub>0</sub> + 1
      if NodeScheduled(n, s) break;
    if n cannot be scheduled break;
    
NodeScheduled(n, s)
  Check resources of n at s in modulo reservation table
```

If your loop is such that:
* Every operation uses only 1 resource
* There are no cyclic dependencies on the loop

**You can always meet the lower bound.** You just keep stretching the cycle until you pack them all in.
